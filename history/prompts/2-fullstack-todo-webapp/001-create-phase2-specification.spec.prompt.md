## Prompt

User requested: "Transform the Phase I console todo app into a full-stack web application with Next.js 16+ frontend, Python FastAPI backend, and Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database, implementing all 5 Basic Level features as a multi-user web application with authentication. Include Intermediate Level features: priority dropdown in task form with high/medium/low options and colored badges (red/yellow/green) in task list, tagging system with Tag table having many-to-many relationship to Tasks with tag input supporting multiple tags and autocomplete, search bar filtering tasks by keyword across title and description, filter controls for status/priority/tags with multi-select, sort dropdown with options for created date/due date/priority/title with ascending/descending toggle, all filters and sorts combined and applied to API queries with proper indexes."

The user provided extensive detail about monorepo structure, frontend (Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Better Auth), backend (FastAPI, SQLModel, JWT verification), database models (User, Task, Tag, TaskTag junction table with indexes), API endpoints (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH for tasks and tags), security requirements (JWT on all endpoints, user isolation, input validation), deployment (Vercel frontend, Railway/Render backend), and testing requirements (component tests, API tests, authentication flow tests, user isolation tests).

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Phase II specification with:

**User Stories (10 total)**:
- P1: User Registration and Authentication (foundation for multi-user system)
- P1: Create and View Tasks via Web Interface (core MVP functionality)
- P2: Update and Delete Tasks (essential maintenance operations)
- P2: Mark Tasks as Complete (progress tracking)
- P3: Prioritize Tasks with Colored Badges (organization enhancement)
- P3: Organize Tasks with Tags (advanced categorization)
- P3: Search Tasks by Keyword (discoverability)
- P3: Filter Tasks by Status/Priority/Tags (power user features)
- P4: Sort Tasks by Different Criteria (polish feature)
- P1: User Isolation and Data Security (fundamental security requirement)

Each story includes clear priority justification, independent test description, and 3-5 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format.

**Functional Requirements (47 total)** organized by category:
- Authentication & User Management (FR-001 to FR-007)
- Task CRUD Operations (FR-008 to FR-015)
- Priority Management (FR-016 to FR-019)
- Tagging System (FR-020 to FR-025)
- Search & Filter (FR-026 to FR-031)
- Sorting (FR-032 to FR-035)
- Security & Data Isolation (FR-036 to FR-041)
- User Interface (FR-042 to FR-047)

**Key Entities**: User, Task, Tag, TaskTag (junction table)

**Success Criteria (14 measurable outcomes)**: All technology-agnostic, including time-based metrics, performance metrics, quality metrics, and usability metrics.

**Edge Cases (14 identified)**: Validation limits, security attacks, concurrency, network failures, performance boundaries.

**Assumptions (14) & Out of Scope (18)**: Documented boundaries and future phase items.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready Phase II specification with 10 prioritized user stories, 47 functional requirements, 14 success criteria, and complete validation checklist
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality validation passed 16/16 checks (100% pass rate)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (344 lines) and checklists/requirements.md (complete validation)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to design architecture, or `/sp.clarify` if stakeholder refinement needed
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances comprehensive detail (Phase II requirements) with clear boundaries (out-of-scope items for Phases III-V). Security treated as P1 requirement (user isolation), not afterthought. All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification passed all validation checks on first attempt
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist validation PASS (16/16), No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (PASS), All requirements testable (PASS), Success criteria technology-agnostic (PASS)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - initial specification creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - specification complete and validated
